Chada Tech Clocks - Project 1

## Overview

The project is known as Chada Tech Clocks: an application that displays time, allowing the user to visualize the current time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats simultaneously. The implementation of this project fulfills the requirement for an intuitive interface showing time in various formats, whether it be a more traditional 12-hour AM/PM clock or the 24-hour military format.

## Reflection
What did you do particularly well?

This is particularly good because the implementation of formatting for both time systems ensures that displays of the time are clean and aligned and uniform in format even if leading zeros are displayed. 

### Where could you improve your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

This could be something like optimizing the updating of time, probably adding a real-time clock, or also enhanced user input error checking. This would make the program easier to use and more realistic for any application in the real world. Advanced error handling would prevent the crash of the program upon some incorrect user inputs.

### Which part of the code did you find most difficult to write? How were you able to get past this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging parts were the reasoning behind converting the 24-hour time to a 12-hour time and having the two clocks synchronized with each other. These were overcome by knowing the concepts of modular arithmetic and format specifier utility in C++. Referencing official C++ documentation such as that about `iomanip`, as well as community forums like Stack Overflow, proved great assets during troubleshooting and making sense of all the subtleties possible with time format.

### What do you think are some of the skills that were employed in this project that will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Formatted output and the modular logic to convert between time formats have broad applicability to many projects, especially those requiring formatted or structured output. This project also reinforced important core elements of programming, like functions, control structures, and input/output handling that are each valuable in just about any coding project.

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The structure is clear, and functions are present to encapsulate various operations, making the program maintainable and readable. The code can be extended further by adding, for instance, analog or binary clocks. This would be implemented easily through functions, such as `displayClocks()`, while the code will remain extensible due to its modular design: changes in display or development of new features would require minimal changes in individual functions, not in the codebase as a whole.

## Conclusion
In all, the Chada Tech Clocks project provided experience with time formatting, modular code design, and user-friendly program output-a good foundation on which improvements and further learning may take place in C++ programming.
